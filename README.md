# Data and Databases Curriculum

Second-semester core course in the Columbia Journalism School Data Journalism MS program. This course teaches students to work with datasets that require more than pandas and a laptop - government databases with millions of records, document dumps from investigations, and long-term data projects that multiple journalists need to access.
