# Data and Databases Curriculum Revamp

Second-semester core course in the Columbia Journalism School Data Journalism MS program. This course teaches students to work with datasets that require more than pandas and a laptop - government databases with millions of records, document dumps from investigations, and long-term data projects that multiple journalists need to access.

> Under active development and so, so, so much of the writing is lazily done via Claude Code. Have I verified that any of these investigations it's talking about exist? *Absolutely not!*
